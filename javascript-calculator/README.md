# Javascript Calculator

It's a javascript calculator I built for FreeCodeCamp.  There's one bug I know of where it does not process the answer correctly if you add do multiple negative subtractions in a row (i.e. 6-(-9)-(-7)) which I hope to address soon.  One of the tests is not passing, but I chose not to bother with it because the premise was based on how it would process 5 * - + 5.  I opted for a safeguard instead that would not allow the user to insert three operators in a row.  Other than that, I felt good about this one.  It was lots of fun.
